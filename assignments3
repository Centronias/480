TESTING PARSER
1
	Shortest length terminal word is ATOM eg. 9
	Next shortest length is 2, ATOM ATOM eg. 9 9
2
	Because S -> S S, you can generate a chain of S derivations to produce terminal words of any given length.
3
	The parsing algorithm can be rewriten to produce strings rather than consume them simply by producing tokens rather than consuming them. The generator can randomly choose productions to use for each nonterminal symbol, effectively a random walker through the confines of a parse tree for this grammar.
